Quartz (linux 1.19.2 fix)

>This fixes quartz for linux for version 1.19.2 regarding the OpenGL selector. Ideally Quartz should have a fix to check OS and ignore the seletor. 
>Until this issue is fixed in quartz I do not recommend using BiggerReactors in any modpack, because it does some odd OpenGL things.
